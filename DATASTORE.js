    question: 'Although it was forgotten for many years after opening in 1786, the Catacombs of Paris opened to public visitation 88 years later and eventually became a popular tourist site. It was originally constructed as a critical alternative to the overwhelming numbers of dead citizens buried in major parishes.

    question: 'Gaius Julius Caesar, better known as Caligula, came to power as Rome\'s Emperor on March 17th, 37 CE. He was protected by the Praetorian Guard, an elite unit of soldiers that acted as the Emperor\'s personal bodyguards. Although at first Caligula was extremely popular amongst the commoners, his reportedly perverse behavior and harsh actions against the Senate and upper crust of Roman society led to his assassination a few years later by some of the very same guards who were supposed to protect him. He wasn\'t the last to meet his fate this way. How many Roman emperors in total were assassinated by the Praetorian Guard?',

    question: 'Eugene Francois Vidocq was the first known private detective, and his chaotic early life and eventual redemption helped inspired Victor Hugo to write Les Miserables. His many contributions to forensics and criminology include ballistic analysis, the entire concept of undercover work and plaster casts of shoe prints. However, in his early years he was something of a career criminal, which kept him from being fully accepted by many in turn-of-the-19th-century French society.
